### Apply linear regression on the iris dataset but using Sepal Length as the target and rest of the features as the dataset

### In many learning problems ,the data sets have a large number of variables .One of the most popular techniques for dimensionality reduction for sparse data (data with many zero values) is Singular Value Decomposition, or SVD.A multi-class classification approach called Linear Discriminant Analysis, or LDA, can be used to reduce the number of classes in a dataset.
